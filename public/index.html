		Welcome to the NASA Open API<br>Tutorial</br>
	</h1>
	
	<div class="subheading">
		<p>This tutorial will lead you through some of the APIs that are part of the 
		<a class="newtab" href="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA API</a>. If at anytime
		you'd like to check out NASA's site click on their logo to be taken directly there.  		 We'll be looking at the Astronomy Picture of the Day or APOD, initially to get 
		introduced to API interactions.  Then, we'll delve into the Mars Rover API for some
		more exciting content.
		
		<p>The tutorial assumes that you have a working knowledge APIs, JSON, Node.js, 
		Express and Javascript. But not to worry we'll take it step by step in order to make 
		sure you don't get lost in space!</p>
		
		<p>What is the NASA API?</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html">"The objective of this site is 
		to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application 
		developers." --https://api.nasa.gov</blockquote>
		
		<p>Not all of us will get to go to space, but through the NASA API we can explore
		some beautiful imagery, information about our planet, our neighbor Mars and 
		other parts of the universe!</p>
