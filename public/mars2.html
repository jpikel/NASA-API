			Welcome to the NASA Open API<br>Mars Pictures Rover API</br>
		</h1>
	
			<div class="subheading">
		<h2>Section 5: Mars Rover Photos</h2>
		<hr></hr>
			<p>We're almost done!  Now we have a method to get some data about our rover.  
			But remember there is another GET request for this particular API.  
			Building on our previous example we'll make a simple call to this new page at 
			<code>https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&api_key=DEMO_KEY</code>
			 Notice that we need to actually be in a directory for the rover name, so 
			 we'll actually truncate this 
			 url a bit to <code>https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/</code> 
			 and from there we can add
			 all of the pieces we need to get to the pictures we want.</p>
			 
			 <p>So we'll need to add in the rover's name as the directory, then 
			 <code>/photos?</code><br>
			 and finally our queries such as 
			 <code>sol=number&camera=abbreviation&api_key=DEMO_KEY</code>
			 
			 <hr></hr>
		<h4>Example</h4>
			 <p>So in order for this work we'll make another <code>app.get()</code> 
			 in our <em>interface.js</em> file. It 
			 should look very similar to the others in that all it is doing to passing 
			 along information to NASA
			 and then sending only the responseText back to us the client or in this case 
			 our Fiddle. The app.get() we want to add is:</p>

			<pre class="codeContainer">
			

116 //This function will serve as the pass through to get a request from
117 //NASA Mars Rover API within a specific directory
118 //To keep most of the work in our fiddle it will expect a few queries
119 //dir=directory/photos
120 //sol=solday
121 //camera=camera chosen
122 //The only thing this app.get() will do is append the api_key
123 app.get('/roverpics', function(req, res){
124     var url = "https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/";
125
126     res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
127
128     if(Object.keys(req.query).length != 0){
129         url += req.query["dir"]
130         url += "?sol=" + req.query["sol"]
131         url += "&camera=" + req.query["camera"]+ "&" + apiKey;
132         var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;
133         var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
134
135         //open our request asynchronously
136         req.open("GET", url, true);
137
138         //we add an eventListener to wait until data returned
139         req.addEventListener('load', function(){
140             if(req.status >=200 && req.status < 400){
141                 res.send(req.responseText);
142             } else {
143                 res.status(400);
144                 res.send(req.responseText);
145                 
146             }
147         });
148         req.send(null);
149     }
150     else {
151         res.send("No queries submitted cannot submit to NASA API");
152     }
153
154 });



			</pre>
			
			<p>When we make a GET request to our server/roverpics it will expect the 
			following query 
			<br>
			<code>?dir=curiosity/photos&sol=0&camera=mast</code>, this is an example
			where we chose Curiosity, Sol=0, and we want Camera=MAST. Again, remember 
			the server will handle adding <code>&api_key=[api_key]</code></p>
			
			<p>Then it will take the queries we sent and put together the URL with 
			queries for the Mars-Rover API, in the format described above.</p>
			
			<p><em>Errors:</em> sometimes the database can not find the pictures we 
			desire, so in that case we'll set our
			<code>res.status(400)</code> arbitrarily because we want to pass along 
			the error from the NASA API to our client, that something went wrong.
			Also the error message is contained in the <code>req.responseText</code> 
			so we still want to send that back as well.</p>
			
			<p>With that taken care of let's Fiddle</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<h4>Fiddle Example</h4>
			<div class="fiddle">
				<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://jsfiddle.net/pikelj/jnLnw7eo/19/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			</div>
			
			<p>For this fiddle we want to specific study the <code>getPictures()</code> 
			function.  First you can see the payload
			to be explicitly put together as 
			<code>?dir=<rover name>/photos&sol=<sol value>&camera=<camera></code>  
			So our server
			app will parse this information and put it together into the correct 
			format to be send to the NASA API.</p>
			
			<p>Then we open a new request to our newly created <em>app.get()</em> on 
			our interface.js server.  When we received the
			response it will have a structure similar to the below.  Our fiddle 
			will use the photos object to display each of the
			key value pairs.  The photos object is described in more detail below.</p>
			
			<pre class="codeContainer">
{"photos":[{"id":5105,
	    "sol":756,
	    "camera":{
	      "id":20,
	      "name":"FHAZ",
	      "rover_id":5,
	      "full_name":"Front Hazard Avoidance Camera"},
	    "img_src":"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl...JPG",
	    "earth_date":"2014-09-21",
	    "rover":{"id":5,
		     "name":"Curiosity",
		     "landing_date":"2012-08-06",
		     "launch_date":"2011-11-26",
		     "status":"active",
		     "max_sol":1514,
		     "max_date":"2016-11-08",
		     "total_photos":287598,
		     "cameras":[
			{"name":"FHAZ","full_name":"Front Hazard Avoidance Camera"},
			{"name":"NAVCAM","full_name":"Navigation Camera"},
			{"name":"MAST","full_name":"Mast Camera"},
			{"name":"CHEMCAM","full_name":"Chemistry and Camera Complex"},
			{"name":"MAHLI","full_name":"Mars Hand Lens Imager"},
			{"name":"MARDI","full_name":"Mars Descent Imager"},
			{"name":"RHAZ","full_name":"Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera"}]}}]}
				</pre>
			
			<p>The Photos object returned is an array of these objects, 
			but they are all filtered so we only get back the camera we selected 
			for that day.
			Each Photo contains a Rover object with the same information about the 
			Rover as we have already queried from the Manifest.
			But we are mainly interested in the <code>img_src</code> and the very first 
			<code>id</code> which is the id of the photo.</p>
						
			<p>Thus in our function <code>getPictures()</code>we do need to dig a bit to 
			get the some of the additional
			information.  The first for loop iterates the length of the <em>photos</em> 
			object. Then for each key in the 
			<em>photos[index]</em> we want to get those properties.  <em>Camera</em> 
			is another object so we'll again 
			iterate through the camera object. Finally each key:value pair is added to 
			a new <code>&#60p&#62</code> and
			added to the <code>&#60div&#62</code>. Lastly we're not so much interested 
			in the <em>rover</em> object so we'll 
			just leave that for the time being, meaning that when it is added as text content
			it will show up as an [object]. </p>
			<p>Also one additional cleanup function has been added that simply gets rid of
			the div if we chose a different sol day or rover. 
			Hopefully, things won't get messy.</p>
			
			<p>So then for our next fiddle we'll iterate through each of these array 
			objects in the photos object and add the pictures to our html 
			body along with their id, so we can reference back to them if necessary.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<h4>Finally some eye candy of Mars</h4>
		<div class="fiddle">
			<iframe width="110%" height="500" src="https://jsfiddle.net/pikelj/jnLnw7eo/20/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>
		
		<p>So in this fiddle we are using the same function <code>getPictures()</code> 
		except now we only iterate through the 
		<em>Photos</em> object and specifically get the <em>"img_src"</em> and <em>"id"</em>
		and add these to a new img tag and span tag in the same &#60div&#62 as before.</p>
		
		<p>Of course with some good creativity and design you can easily use these 
		components to build a nice website that will allow users
		to browse the surface of Mars from the comfort of their living room.</p>
		
		<p>I hope that you have enjoyed this tutorial.  The final link below will let 
		you see the Astronomy Picture of the Day in 
		full HD!  The universe certainly is a beautful place!</p>
