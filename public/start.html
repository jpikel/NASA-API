		Welcome to the NASA Open API<br>Introduction</br>

		<h2>Section 1: Getting Started</h2>

		<h4>What is an API?</h4>
		
			<p><em>API</em> stands for <em>Application Programming Interface</em>
			and it is a set of tools, functions and provides excellent basic building 
			blocks to build from. This allows a developer to have access to this "library"
			of resources without needing to know the mechanics behind everything.  In this
			way we can readily build up a program, application or parts quickly to make
			something of our own.
			</p>
			
			<p>In this case we'll be accessing some of the great information and data
			that NASA has avaiable on their API.
			</p>
			<p>For further reading about APIs check out these pages:</p>

			</br>
			</p>
			
			<p>Think of an API like lego blocks.  Each block has certain properties, such
			as size, shape, color.	In our case though each block could be seen as a call 
			to the API for a certain set of data, through a query. Some blocks may 
			only connect to other blocks in a specific order or	as in our case if the 
			correct information is received.  Then when you have all the
			correct building blocks you can build something awesome like this!</p>

		<h4>What is JSON?</h4>
			<p>JSON, pronounced <rt>" jay-s&#601n"</rt>, or JavaScript Object Notation 
			is an open standard	format that is used to transmit data objects in such a 
			way that it is easily read and written by us, humans. Now JSON is could be
			considered one of the most common methods to transmit data to and from an API.
			</p>
			<p>For an excellent description of JSON perform a 
			<a class="newtab" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit">Hohmann Transfer</a> to 
			<a class="newtab" href="http://www.json.org/"> json.org</a>.


		<h4>Example</h4>
			<div class="fiddle">
				<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://jsfiddle.net/pikelj/3fhhcfLu/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			</div>
			
			<p>In the example we create two new javascript objects, the first is 
			in JSON notation and the second in standard javascript notation.  
			In javascript accessing elements is very forgiving.</p>
			
			<p>We can use dot notation as in <code>JSONobj.foo</code> or with brackets 
			and a string as in <code>JSONobj["key"]</code>.</p>
			
			<p>The <em>critical</em> thing to remember in all of this is that a JSON 
			object's keys must be <em>enclosed in double quotes</em> "". Whereas a 
			javascript object does not have this requirement.</p>
			
			<p>The other important thing to remember is that the value side of JSON 
			notation may <em>only contain</em>
			a string, number, object, array, or bool.  Whereas a javascript object 
			may contain a function.</p>
			
		<h4>JSON Stringify</h4>
			<p>Luckily JSON gives us a great tool to convert any javascript object 
			to the JSON format with the use	of the <code>stringify()</code> method.</p>
			
			<div class="fiddle">
				<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://jsfiddle.net/pikelj/byj6vvkm/4/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>In this example we only have a single object in javascript notation,
			first we just try to output the javascript object to an 
			html element.  Resulting as expected the output stating it is an 
			[object Object].</p>
			<p>Then we see that after calling <code>JSON.stringify()</code> on our object 
			we can now output the entire object as a long string to the element "stringy".
			</p>
			<p>The NASA API will return JSON notation objects so we'll need to call
			<code>JSON.parse()</code> on them in order to
			access the data contained inside. As shown in the example once we parse 
			the stringified object, we are able to once again access the elements inside.
			Using dot notation or brackets and a string.</p>
