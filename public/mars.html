			Welcome to the NASA Open API<br>Mars Rover API</br>
		</h1>
	
			<div class="subheading">
		<h2>Section 4: Mars Rover Photos</h2>
			<p>This API is very fascinating.  It gives us access to the images collected by 
			the	three Mars Rovers: Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit.  The photos are 
			all stored in a database and there are a number of queries we may pass to 
			this API.  We can query by date	specifically by n-th Sol which is a Martian 
			day as related to the rover.  So the 0th Sol day is the
			day that the rover landed. The API also allows queries by  earth day.  
			Lastly we can filter our search
			by the cameras avaiable and there are a number of cameras avaiable on each Rover
			.</p>
			
			<p>For a detailed look at the cameras available, their abbreviations 
			and some information about
			this API please head over to the API's 
			<a class="newtab" href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos"><em>page</em></a>.</p>
			
			<p>That is a lot of information for a casual user to know about the Rovers.  
			So the API also has another feature called the Mission Manifest, this 
			GET call will return to us some detailed information about a particular Rover.
			</p>
			
			<p>So we are going to start by getting the information about each of the rovers.
			Remember their names were: Curiosity, Opporunity, and Spirit.</p>
			
			<p>As an aside, the DEMO_KEY is very limited in the number of requests we're 
			allowed to use and while developing I quickly
			ran against the limit.  Thus the use of a registered API key is very benefical.
			So we'll update our <em>interface.js</em> with another app.get as follows</p>
			
			<pre class="codeContainer">
 80 //This function handles gets to the /manifests page
 81 //This will request the mission manifest from NASA Mars-Rovers API
 82 //If the query from the client is blank then we'll default to Curiosity
 83 //If a wrong query is submitted we'll notify the client
 84 //Query should be submitted as name=rover
 85 app.get('/manifests', function(req,res){
 86     var url = "https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/manifests/";
 87
 88     if(Object.keys(req.query).length != 0){
 89         url += req.query["name"];
 90     } else {
 91         url += "curiosity";
 92     }
 93
 94     url += "?"  + apiKey;
 95     //used for the GET request
 96     var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;
 97     var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
 98
 99     //open our request asynchronously
100     req.open("GET", url, true);
101     req.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');

102     //we add an eventListener to wait until data returned
103     req.addEventListener('load', function(){
104         if(req.status >=200 && req.status < 400){
105 //          console.log(req);
107             res.send(req.responseText);
108         } else {
110             res.send("Server error or incorrect query");
111         }
112     });
113     req.send(null);
114 });

		</pre>
			
		<h4>Example Fiddle</h4>
			<p>In this fiddle we are making a request to our proxy server. The server 
			interface expects a query of name=rover so we'll add a text box to get 
			some input from the
			client and then using a small function we'll output the response we get 
			back from our server.
			Note our proxy server is only acting as a pass through. In the fiddle
			there are a few lines of code that will display the reposne to the results page 
			of the fiddle, instead of the console.</p>
			
			<p><code> console = {log:function(text){$("#console-log").append($(consoleLine).html(text));}};</code>
			Handles our output so that instead of sending the output to the browser's 
			console we're actually appending it to the div with id="console-log" in 
			the html body</p>
			
			<p>You may enter Curiosity, Spirit, or Opportunity into the text box.  
			If you leave it blank the proxy server will default to curiosity.</p>

		<h3>WOW</h3>
			<p>That is a ton of data to parse!</p>
			<p>So then we have a ton of information here, but how are we going to use it?</p>
			<p>We see that inside of <code>responseText</code> there is one main object n
			amely <code>photo_manifest</code>.  
			The basic information inside of <code>photo_manifest</code>
			is a series of key value pairs<br>
			<table id="roverinfo">
				<caption>Basic Rover information</caption>
				<tr><td>name:</td><td> name of the rover we asked for</td>
				<tr><td>landing_date:</td><td> the Earth date the rover landed in YYYY-MM-DD
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>launch_date:</td><td> the Earth date the rover launched</td></tr>
				<tr><td>status:</td><td> whether the mission is still active or complete</td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>max_sol:</td><td> how many martian days the rover has been on Mars
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>max_date:</td><td> the last date in the database that we can asked 
				for in Earth days</td></tr>
				<tr><td>total_photos:</td><td> how many photos from all cameras are stored
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>photos object:</td><td> let's look at this in detail</td></tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			<table id="roverinfo">
				<caption>Photos Object</caption>
				<tr><td colspan="2">The basic structure of an element in photos is</td></tr>
				<tr><td colspan="2">{\"sol\":1,\"total_photos\":16,\"cameras\":[\"MAHLI\",\"MAST\",\"NAVCAM\"]},</td></tr>
				<tr><td>sol:</td><td>The Sol day</td></tr>
				<tr><td>total_photos</td><td>Photos taken on that day</td></tr>
				<tr><td>cameras</td><td>Yet another object containing an array of the cameras used</td></tr>
			</table>
			</p>
		
			<p>The photos object is a very long array of key=value pairs and the camera 
			object.  So, we'll want to handle this response in stages such that we don't need
			to immediately display all the contents of the photos object.</p>

			<p>This is all very excellent information, but still what can we do with this.  
			Let's set off now to make an interactive experience that let's a user select 
			a Rover, select a date in relation to that rover's max sol date.  Then the 
			user will be notified of how many photos were stored on that day and what 
			cameras were used.</p>
			
			<p>Then the user is allowed to chose one of the avaiable cameras. 
			Once the camera is chosen for that particular Sol day and Rover, 
			we'll then query the Mars-Rover API to retrieve the list of 
			photos avaiable, for the rover, sol day and camera chosen by the client.</p>
			
			<div class="fiddle">
			<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://jsfiddle.net/pikelj/hvf82k42/31/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			</div>
			
			<p>That's a lot of code! But let's break it apart.</p>
			<p><code>getData()</code> does what we expect, it sends
			a request to our server based on the Rover we chose in the dropdown menu.  
			It defaults to Curiosity.
			<p>
			When the req is received, we assign the  
			<code>JSON.parse(req.responseText)</code> to <code>var response</code>
			This way we now	have a JS object instead of a string, that will allow us
			access to the elements.  We want access to the
			photo_manifest so we assign the photo_manifest key to another <code> var
			photo_manifest</code>, this way we may pass this object to our next function.</p>
			<p>We'll separately store the 
			<code>photos</code> object inside of photos_manifest
			in local storage on the browser so that
			we may access that information at a later date.</p>
			<p>Next we need to print only the top-level Rover Data, so it
			makes a call to printData()</p>
			
			<p><code>printData()</code> generates a new table and adds it to the html body.  
			For each key in the photo_manifest it creates a new row and cell and then adds 
			the "key" and "value" to that cell.  Notice
			though that for now it skips the "key" <em>photos</em>.  The reason for this 
			is that photos is a large object
			that contains an array of objects and we don't want to print a huge wall of 
			text will all the entries. Instead this same
			function creates a range slider (new feature in HTML5), that allows the user 
			to select a particular Sol day for the
			Rover.  The range slide gets has values from the 0th Solday to the max_sol key
			in the photo_manifest. When the Get Sol Day button is clicked, 
			another function is called <code>getPics()</code></p>
			
			<p><code>getPics()</code> finds the index location that has a Sol day 
			that is nearest to the Sol day the user	selected.  There were some days 
			the rovers didn't take any pictures or there are no pictures in the database 
			and so the index location in the array does not correspond directly to the 
			sol day.  </p>
			
			<p>Once the nearest match is found another table is generated that displays 
			to the user the actual Sol day found, the number of  pictures taken that day, and
			the cameras used.</p>
			
			<p>There are also two clean up functions that we call to remove the tables, 
			if we change our selection and requery the server.</p>

			<hr></hr>
		<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
			<p>Now we can access our Manifest for a Rover and can get a bunch of 
			data for it. But we actually want to get some of 
			the relavant pictures for that Sol day that we chose.  Head on to the 
			next page to see the implementation of that and
			finally get a beautiful visual reward.</p>
